# React-Forms-Validations
We are going to create a React form with validation. We'll use state to manage form inputs and errors.
Steps:

Create a form with multiple fields (e.g., name, email, password).

Validate each field on change and on form submission.

Display error messages for each field if validation fails.

Only allow form submission when there are no errors.

We'll use the following validations:

Name: required, at least 2 characters.

Email: required, valid email format.

Password: required, at least 6 characters.

We'll create:

State for form data and errors.

Handle change for each input to update state and validate.

Handle submit to check all validations and prevent submission if errors.

Let's code accordingly.
